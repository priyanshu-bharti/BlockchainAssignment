# Assignment

To run the assignment, Clone this repo and then run the following commands to start the client and server.

For convenience I have provided the overview of the ![system](./App\ overview.mp4) and the ![web app demo](./App\ overview.mp4) videos, Also I have pushed the .env file just for trying out.

- If you want to run it locally on your system change the DB connection string in `server/.env` file and run the commands below.

## Running the client and server.

```sh
# Start the client
cd ./client && npm install && npm run dev

# Start the server
cd ./server && npm install && npm run dev

```
